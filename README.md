## Results:

As can be seen from the experiments and the graph representation of those, the Boyer-Moore algorithm seems to be the fastest of all three for 3 out of 4 experiment types, and is on par with the 4th type (failure to find a substring in Text 2). At the same time, the Rabin-Karp method is decidedly the slowest.

Looking at the performance text-wise, the evidence suggests that the KMP and the Rabin-Karp algorithms are far better optimized for Text 1. Text 2, in its turn, presents a challenge for all three algorithms, especially when an algorithm fails to find the substring.
